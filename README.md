PP2 2026 — Spring Semester, Practice Collection

This repository is a collection of Python “practice snippets” that cover the **core Python basics** taught in an **Programming Principles II** course. This course requires us to upload all practice examples/snippet codes that cover the basic topics (aligned with the Python basics learning path on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)).

## What’s inside

- Short, focused `.py` files
- Each file demonstrates a single concept (or a small related group)
- Folder names are organized by topic

## How to run

### Option A: Run a single file

From the repository root:

```bash
python "Practice 01/strings/split.py"
```

### Option B: Run inside VS Code

1. Open a `.py` file.
2. Use **Run Python File** (top-right play button) or the VS Code Run menu.

## Suggested learning order

If you’re following Python basics in a structured way, this order usually works well:

1. Getting started → execution
2. Syntax → indentation, comments, variables
3. Data types → built-in types overview
4. Numbers → int/float/complex, conversions
5. Strings → slicing, escape chars, split
6. Casting → `int()`, `float()`, `str()`

## Repository goal

- Keep examples small and easy to review
- Provide quick reference code for each basic topic
- Support course submission requirements

## License / usage
